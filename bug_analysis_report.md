## Bug #1: Command Injection Vulnerability in FFmpeg Execution

### **Severity**: HIGH (Security Vulnerability)
### **Location**: `inspector/app.py`, lines 140-153
### **Type**: Security - Command Injection

### **Description**
The application constructs FFmpeg command arguments using string concatenation with user-controlled input from S3 object keys. While the immediate risk was limited since paths are derived from S3 keys, this represents a potential command injection vulnerability if malicious filenames are uploaded.

### **Root Cause**
- Insufficient validation of file paths before passing to subprocess
- Improper escaping of shell metacharacters in FFmpeg filter expressions
- Missing path traversal protection

### **Vulnerable Code**
```python
scene_cmd = [
    'stdbuf', '-oL', '-eL',
    'ffmpeg', '-hide_banner', '-loglevel', 'info',
    '-i', local_path,  # Unvalidated user input
    '-vf', 'select=gt(scene\,0.8),showinfo',  # Improper escaping
    '-f', 'null', '-'
]
```

### **Fix Applied**
1. Added path validation to ensure files are in expected `/tmp/` directory
2. Fixed shell escaping in FFmpeg filter expression
3. Added existence check before command execution

### **Fixed Code**
```python
# Validate local_path to prevent command injection
if not os.path.exists(local_path) or not local_path.startswith('/tmp/'):
    raise Exception(f"Invalid or unsafe file path: {local_path}")

scene_cmd = [
    'stdbuf', '-oL', '-eL',
    'ffmpeg', '-hide_banner', '-loglevel', 'info',
    '-i', local_path,
    '-vf', 'select=gt(scene\\,0.8),showinfo',  # Properly escaped
    '-f', 'null', '-'
]
```

## Bug #2: Database Session Resource Leak

### **Severity**: MEDIUM (Performance/Reliability Issue)
### **Location**: `inspector/db.py`, multiple functions
### **Type**: Resource Management - Memory/Connection Leak

### **Description**
Database sessions were not properly closed in exception scenarios across multiple database functions. This could lead to connection pool exhaustion under high load or when exceptions occur frequently, potentially causing the application to become unresponsive.

### **Root Cause**
- Inconsistent exception handling in database operations
- Sessions not closed in finally blocks
- Missing try-finally patterns for resource cleanup

### **Vulnerable Functions**
- `add_video()`
- `update_duplicates()`
- `find_duplicates()`
- `get_video_by_id()`
- `get_video_by_filename()`

### **Example Vulnerable Code**
```python
def add_video(filename, thumbnail_path=None):
    session = SessionLocal()
    video = Video(filename=filename, thumbnail_path=thumbnail_path)
    session.add(video)
    session.commit()
    session.refresh(video)
    session.close()  # Not called if exception occurs above
```

### **Fix Applied**
Wrapped all database operations in proper try-finally blocks to ensure sessions are always closed:

### **Fixed Code**
```python
def add_video(filename, thumbnail_path=None):
    session = SessionLocal()
    try:
        video = Video(filename=filename, thumbnail_path=thumbnail_path)
        session.add(video)
        session.commit()
        session.refresh(video)
        return video
    finally:
        session.close()  # Always called, even on exception
```

## Bug #3: Race Condition in Analysis Results Management

### **Severity**: HIGH (Data Integrity Issue)
### **Location**: `inspector/app.py`, `analyze_file()` function
### **Type**: Concurrency - Race Condition

### **Description**
Multiple video files with the same filename could interfere with each other during concurrent analysis. The system used filename as the key for storing analysis results, causing newer analysis to overwrite ongoing analysis of files with identical names.

### **Root Cause**
- Analysis results keyed only by filename
- No unique identifier for concurrent analysis sessions
- Cleanup logic that could interfere with ongoing analysis

### **Vulnerable Scenario**
1. User uploads `video.mp4` â†’ Analysis starts
2. Before first analysis completes, user uploads another `video.mp4`
3. Second analysis deletes results from first analysis
4. First analysis results are lost or corrupted

### **Vulnerable Code**
```python
def analyze_file(bucket, key):
    filename = key.split('/')[-1]
    local_path = f"/tmp/{filename}"
    # Cleanup could affect concurrent analysis of same filename
    with analysis_lock:
        if filename in analysis_results:
            del analysis_results[filename]  # Deletes ongoing analysis!
```

### **Fix Applied**
1. Created unique identifiers for each analysis session
2. Modified result storage to use unique keys while maintaining backward compatibility
3. Updated result lookup to search by original filename across all analysis keys

### **Fixed Code**
```python
def analyze_file(bucket, key):
    import uuid
    filename = key.split('/')[-1]
    # Create unique identifier to prevent race conditions
    unique_id = f"{int(time.time())}_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
    local_path = f"/tmp/{unique_id}_{filename}"
    analysis_key = f"{unique_id}_{filename}"
    
    # Store results with unique key but include original filename
    with analysis_lock:
        analysis_results[analysis_key] = {
            'status': 'analyzing',
            'original_filename': filename,
            # ... other fields
        }
```

## Bug #4: SQS Queue Initialization Logic Error

### **Severity**: MEDIUM (Service Reliability Issue)
### **Location**: `inspector/app.py`, `poll_sqs()` function
### **Type**: Logic Error - Initialization Race Condition

### **Description**
The SQS queue initialization logic had a flaw where after creating a queue, the code would continue to the next iteration of the retry loop without attempting to get the queue URL immediately. This caused unnecessary delays and potential failures during service startup, especially in environments like LocalStack where queue creation might take time to propagate.

### **Root Cause**
- Queue creation and URL retrieval were not properly sequenced
- Missing retry logic immediately after queue creation
- Insufficient error handling during queue creation process
- No delay to allow LocalStack to fully initialize the created queue

### **Vulnerable Code**
```python
for attempt in range(10):
    try:
        queue_url = sqs.get_queue_url(QueueName='video-events')['QueueUrl']
        break
    except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
        error_code = e.response.get('Error', {}).get('Code')
        if error_code == 'AWS.SimpleQueueService.NonExistentQueue':
            print("[poll_sqs] Queue does not exist. Creating 'video-events' queue...")
            sqs.create_queue(QueueName='video-events')  # Created but not immediately used
        else:
            print(f"Waiting for SQS queue to be available... (attempt {attempt+1})")
            time.sleep(2)
```

### **Problem Scenario**
1. Service starts and tries to get queue URL
2. Queue doesn't exist, so it creates the queue
3. Loop continues to next iteration
4. Tries to get queue URL again before queue is ready
5. Process repeats unnecessarily, causing delays and error messages

### **Fix Applied**
1. Added immediate queue URL retrieval after successful queue creation
2. Implemented proper error handling for queue creation
3. Added appropriate delays for LocalStack initialization
4. Enhanced logging for better debugging

### **Fixed Code**
```python
for attempt in range(10):
    try:
        queue_url = sqs.get_queue_url(QueueName='video-events')['QueueUrl']
        print(f"[poll_sqs] Successfully got queue URL: {queue_url}")
        break
    except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
        error_code = e.response.get('Error', {}).get('Code')
        if error_code == 'AWS.SimpleQueueService.NonExistentQueue':
            print("[poll_sqs] Queue does not exist. Creating 'video-events' queue...")
            try:
                sqs.create_queue(QueueName='video-events')
                print("[poll_sqs] Queue created successfully. Waiting for it to be ready...")
                time.sleep(2)  # Give LocalStack time to initialize the queue
                # Try to get the URL immediately after creation
                queue_url = sqs.get_queue_url(QueueName='video-events')['QueueUrl']
                print(f"[poll_sqs] Successfully got queue URL after creation: {queue_url}")
                break
            except Exception as create_error:
                print(f"[poll_sqs] Error creating queue: {create_error}")
                time.sleep(2)
        else:
            print(f"[poll_sqs] Waiting for SQS queue to be available... (attempt {attempt+1}, error: {error_code})")
            time.sleep(2)
```

## Bug #5: Unsafe String Parsing - Potential IndexError

### **Severity**: MEDIUM (Application Stability Issue)
### **Location**: `inspector/app.py`, line 113 (analyze_file function)
### **Type**: Input Validation - IndexError Risk

### **Description**
The filename extraction logic assumes that S3 keys will always contain forward slashes and that splitting will always yield a valid result. However, edge cases like empty keys, keys without slashes, or malformed S3 event data could cause the application to crash with an IndexError.

### **Root Cause**
- No validation of S3 key format before string operations
- Assumption that `split('/')[-1]` will always return a valid filename
- Missing fallback for edge cases in S3 event data

### **Vulnerable Code**
```python
def analyze_file(bucket, key):
    filename = key.split('/')[-1]  # Could fail if key is empty or None
    # ... rest of function
```

### **Problem Scenarios**
1. Empty S3 key (`key = ""`) â†’ `"".split('/')[-1]` returns `""`
2. None S3 key â†’ `None.split('/')` raises AttributeError
3. Key without slashes (`key = "video.mp4"`) â†’ Works but could be confusing
4. Malformed event data passing unexpected values

### **Fix Applied**
Added robust input validation and fallback handling:

### **Fixed Code**
```python
def analyze_file(bucket, key):
    # Extract filename safely from S3 key
    filename = key.split('/')[-1] if key and '/' in key else key or 'unknown_file'
    if not filename:
        filename = 'unknown_file'
    # ... rest of function
```

### **Benefits of Fix**
- Prevents application crashes from malformed S3 events
- Provides meaningful fallback for edge cases
- Makes the code more robust and defensive
- Maintains functionality for valid inputs while handling invalid ones gracefully

## Bug #6: Duplicate Detection Not Updating in Real-Time

### **Severity**: HIGH (Feature Functionality Issue)
### **Location**: `inspector/app.py`, analysis progress updates
### **Type**: Logic Error - Real-time Updates

### **Description**
The duplicate detection system was not updating the analysis results with found duplicates until the very end of the analysis process. This meant users wouldn't see duplicate alerts during real-time streaming, reducing the effectiveness of the early termination feature.

### **Root Cause**
- Duplicates were only stored in local variables during analysis
- Analysis results were not updated with duplicates until completion
- SSE stream didn't track duplicate changes

### **Vulnerable Code**
```python
# Duplicates found but not stored in analysis_results
if dups and not duplicate_found:
    dups_to_report = [get_video_by_id(d[0]).filename for d in dups]
    duplicate_found = True
    break  # Analysis ends but duplicates not in results yet
```

### **Fix Applied**
Updated analysis results immediately when duplicates are detected:

### **Fixed Code**
```python
with analysis_lock:
    analysis_results[analysis_key]['progress'] = progress
    analysis_results[analysis_key]['scene_cuts'] = scene_timestamps.copy()
    # Update duplicates in real-time if found
    if dups_to_report:
        analysis_results[analysis_key]['duplicates'] = list(set(dups_to_report))
```

## Bug #7: Scene Cut Timestamps Not Displaying Correctly

### **Severity**: MEDIUM (UI/UX Issue)
### **Location**: `frontend/src/App.js`, SSE message handling
### **Type**: Frontend Logic Error

### **Description**
Scene cut timestamps were not displaying correctly in the frontend due to overly complex append logic that prevented proper updates when the complete scene cuts array was received from the backend.

### **Root Cause**
- Complex append-only logic for scene cuts updates
- Frontend tried to merge arrays instead of replacing them
- SSE updates weren't properly triggering UI re-renders for scene cuts

### **Vulnerable Code**
```javascript
setSceneCuts((prev) => {
  if (!Array.isArray(data.scene_cuts)) return prev;
  if (data.scene_cuts.length > prev.length) {
    return [...prev, ...data.scene_cuts.slice(prev.length)];
  }
  return prev;  // No update if length hasn't changed
});
```

### **Fix Applied**
Simplified to direct assignment for more reliable updates:

### **Fixed Code**
```javascript
// Always update scene cuts if present
if (data.scene_cuts && Array.isArray(data.scene_cuts)) {
  setSceneCuts(data.scene_cuts);  // Direct assignment
}
```

## Bug #8: Analysis Progress Bar Not Updating Dynamically

### **Severity**: MEDIUM (UI/UX Issue)
### **Location**: `inspector/app.py`, SSE stream conditions
### **Type**: Performance - Update Frequency

### **Description**
The analysis progress bar was not updating smoothly because the SSE stream had overly restrictive conditions for sending updates. Progress changes smaller than exact floating-point matches were ignored, and the update frequency was too slow for smooth user experience.

### **Root Cause**
- Exact floating-point comparison for progress changes
- Too infrequent SSE updates (0.5s intervals)
- Missing tracking of duplicate detection changes
- No threshold for meaningful progress changes

### **Vulnerable Code**
```python
# Only updates on exact progress match
if (status != last_status or 
    progress != last_progress or  # Exact match required
    scene_cuts_len != last_scene_cuts_len):
    # Send update
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Too slow for smooth updates
```

### **Fix Applied**
Implemented threshold-based progress tracking with more frequent updates:

### **Fixed Code**
```python
# More sensitive progress tracking
progress_changed = last_progress is None or abs(progress - last_progress) >= 0.01
if (status != last_status or
    progress_changed or  # 1% threshold
    scene_cuts_len != last_scene_cuts_len or
    duplicates_len != last_duplicates_len):  # Track duplicates too
    # Send update
    time.sleep(0.2)  # More frequent updates
```
